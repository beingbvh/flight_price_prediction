# FLIGHT TICKET PRICE PREDICTION
Flight price prediction refers to the process of forecasting the future cost of airline tickets based on various factors and historical data. This area has gained significance due to the dynamic nature of airfare, which can fluctuate based on factors such as demand, seasonality, route popularity, fuel prices, competition, and other economic variables.

## Business Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to predict the prices of flight tickets accurately. This prediction can benefit both airlines and passengers by providing insights into ticket pricing trends.

## Data Science Approach:
**Supervised Learning - Regression**: This problem falls under the supervised learning category as we have historical flight data with labeled ticket prices that we can use to train a regression model.
